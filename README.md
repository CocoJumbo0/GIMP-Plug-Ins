# GIMP-Plug-Ins

A collection of plug ins made for quick editing in GIMP.

Requirements
GIMP

Files must be placed in GIMP's plug-in folder to show up in the GUI.
Usually found under 
C:\Users\Your_Name\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins

It can also be found through the GUI
edit > preferences > Folders > Plug-ins
There should be two locations listed. 
I recommend copying and using the users location so plug-ins don't get wiped if you reinstall

Plug-ins will show up under Functionality in the toolbar



### Note: 
pdb (procedure database) exists within GIMP as documentation for tools that are already created. New plug-ins are also added to it as they are created.
