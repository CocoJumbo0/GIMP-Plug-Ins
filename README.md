# GIMP-Plug-Ins

A personal library of plug ins I've created for GIMP and actively use for quick editing.
Files must be placed in GIMP's plug in folders to show up in the GUI 

## Note: 
Need to remove duplicate code. All of these scripts uses the same list all visible function
pdb (procedure database) exists within GIMP as documentation to see what's already created. It's really useful for finding tools.
